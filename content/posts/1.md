**Let's write a script to take and upload pictures** <!--more-->
Bash scripting has always been my goto tool in my line of work. My friend [Miles](https://github.com/justmiles) wanted to have his Slack profile picture updated every 5 mins, so he wrote a [program](https://github.com/justmiles/slack-webcam) in Go to accomplish this. I am not that savvy with Go, and I wanted to do my own implementation in Bash. Below is the code, only 4 lines really. Let’s look at each line and see what it is going on.

```bash
# !/bin/bash
# Upload a new picture to Slack profile to indicate your presence
# put it in your crontab to send every 5 mins
# */5 8–17 * * 1–5 /home/mike/slackProfilePic.sh
# capture image from webcam (use /dev/video0 for default webcam)
streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1
# introduce blur
convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg
# send to slack (get your slack token here: https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789”
# remove image
rm /home/mike/image.jpeg
```
**Walkthrough**

1. `#!/bin/bash` This is called the shebang, and it just tells the computer where the program `bash` lives.
2. Any line that starts with a # means that is it a comment
3. `# */5 8–17 * * 1–5 slackProfilePic.sh` is a comment, but also an example of how the script can be ran by the computer over and over on a cadence by `cron` (more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)). This specific cron entry will run every 5 mins between the hours of 8am and 5pm, Monday through Friday.
4. `streamer -f jpeg -o /home/mike/image.jpeg -c /dev/video1` The capture line. Streamer is a program that captures audio/video. We are using it to just grab one frame from our webcam, and store it on disk in _jpeg_ format. Read more about streamer [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/streamer).
5. `convert -blur 0x2 /home/mike/image.jpeg /home/mike/image.jpeg` The blur line (optional). This line was included to introduce a bit of blur to the newly captured image. I wanted to convey _presence_ without sacrificing privacy. You may choose to change the amount of blur or do something completely different before uploading to Slack. Read more about convert [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php)].
6. `curl https://slack.com/api/users.setPhoto -F “image=@/home/mike/image.jpeg” -F “token=xoxp-123–456–789”` The upload line. Here, a curl request is used to send the new image to your Slack profile picture, using your Slack token. Much more can be found [here](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) about curl, and you can get your own token (and replace this one) [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens).
7. `rm /home/mike/image.jpeg` The cleanup line. This line merely removes the local copy of the image we just uploaded to Slack.


That’s it! I hope you found this useful, and are able to convey your online presence (or lack thereof) using the tools available through Linux.
